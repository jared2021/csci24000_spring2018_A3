the goal of this assignment is to make a simulator for a game of horse
the program is supposed to make use of objects to create two different "players" both with different methods to be used to play the game
the user will not have to input anything
the output should consist of who takes a shot whether they make or miss the shot and whether a player adds a letter to their score
the idea is that a random number generater will determine whether they make or miss the shot 1 for make 2 for miss
then depending on what each player got that round it will either give them the same score as they had before or will increase the letters they have by one
the program will run recursively until one player has the word horse
then once it is over the program will ask if the user would like to play again
if they enter "Y" then the program will run again
if they enter "N" then the program will end
if they do not enter either of these things the program will tell them it doesn't know what it wants it to do and will continue to ask them until they either enter "Y" or "N"
