In our header file I will build the basic player object with a constructor which will have a method to hold the chances the shot will go into the basket and the character array that will hold the word horse
It will also have a deconstructor that will delete the two previously mentioned variables
The Player.cpp file will give meaning to the player object and the player method for the shot percentage
The Game.cpp file will build the game simulation for horse through importing the header file
